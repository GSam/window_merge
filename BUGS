To report bugs that you have found, your best bet is to submit the relevant
information through the site from which you downloaded this package (e.g.,
open a Git Hub issue).  You can also directly e-mail the address that is dotted
around the project's copyright statements, <fedora.dm0@gmail.com>.  Please read
the following issues before reporting to ensure your bug is not already known.

The issues outlined below are all the problems I have encountered in my own
extremely limited testing of this plugin.  This file also serves as a to-do
list for myself with some methods to consider for fixing the problems.

This file was last revised for distribution with version 0.3.


The following is the list of known issues with the plugin, sorted approximately
from most troublesome to least.

* There are a few ways to cause Pidgin to segfault from messing with the dummy
  conversation's tab (dragging it into itself, etc.).  This is mostly because
  the conversation UI doesn't have an active_conv, which some functions use.

  - Trying to fake the active_conv would cause all sorts of other troubles that
    are circumvented by setting it to NULL.

  - Intercepting any GTK events interacting with the dummy tab is a possible
    solution, but it will require a slew of callbacks to cancel user actions.

  I imagine most users will have the tab positions at the top which will hide
  them automatically when there is only one conversation, avoiding this issue.

  + Pidgin ticket #15062 has a patch to allow safely reordering the dummy tab.

* Several cursor movement key bindings were disabled on HTML fields.  This was
  done in order to enable tab switching and message retrieval, since the Buddy
  List window has an event handler that stops events which have a binding
  defined on a focused HTML widget.

  - An alternative to skipping bindings would be to completely remove the Buddy
    List event handler, but that would cause other issues.  (Control+B for bold
    text input would instead activate the "Add Buddy" dialogue, for example.)

  - The related functions in Pidgin are all static, so I can't call them from a
    wrapper function.  The code in question could be duplicated, but I am very
    much against plugins duplicating any part of the main project's code.

* The buddy icon in the status box is positioned from the left of the window,
  based on the Buddy List's width.  This causes it to be drawn over the pane of
  conversations when using the "left" position preference.

  + Pidgin ticket #15046 has a patch to correct this.
