* Updated Distribution of Window Merge 0.2

** Buddy List window

*** The window icon list will be unset when conversations are cloesd or the
    plugin is disabled.  This will cause the window to display the default icon
    of the application, which is what the Buddy List normally displays.

*** Several key events are now properly handled, including message retrieval
    and conversation menu accelerators.

*** When disabling the plugin, conversations open in the Buddy List window will
    be run through conversation placement so they are not lost.


* Initial Distribution of Window Merge 0.1

** Plugin preferences

*** A preference frame interface is provided for choosing on which side of the
    Buddy List window to attach conversations.

*** The height and width (depending on orientation from the above preference)
    of the Buddy List pane are stored as preferences when changed by the user.

*** A new conversation placement preference option is added, allowing all new
    conversations to be attached to the default Buddy List window.

** Buddy List window

*** The notebook in main_vbox is replaced by resizable panes containing the
    Buddy List notebook and a conversation window notebook.

*** An instructions page is displayed in the Buddy List window's conversation
    notebook when no conversations are open.  The tab can be used as a normal
    conversation's infopane; i.e., conversations from other windows can be
    dragged onto it to attach them to the window.

*** The Buddy List window title will be set to the name of the active
    conversation in its notebook, as is done with conversation windows.

*** Items from a conversation window menu bar are appended to the Buddy List
    menu bar.  Their visibility is determined by the presence of active
    conversations in the Buddy List window's conversation notebook.
