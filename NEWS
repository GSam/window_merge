* Initial Distribution of Window Merge 0.1

** Plugin preferences

*** A preference frame interface is provided for choosing on which side of the
    Buddy List window to attach conversations.

*** The height and width (depending on orientation from the above preference)
    of the Buddy List pane are stored as preferences when changed by the user.

*** A new conversation placement preference option is added, allowing all new
    conversations to be attached to the default Buddy List window.

** Buddy List window

*** The notebook in main_vbox is replaced by resizable panes containing the
    Buddy List notebook and a conversation window notebook.

*** An instructions page is displayed in the Buddy List window's conversation
    notebook when no conversations are open.  The tab can be used as a normal
    conversation's infopane; i.e., conversations from other windows can be
    dragged onto it to attach them to the window.

*** The Buddy List window title will be set to the name of the active
    conversation in its notebook, as is done with conversation windows.

*** Items from a conversation window menu bar are appended to the Buddy List
    menu bar.  Their visibility is determined by the presence of active
    conversations in the Buddy List window's conversation notebook.
