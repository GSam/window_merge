This file outlines a few ideas to implement or areas with room for improvement
in the plugin.  These items are not necessarily problems to be addressed; for
those, see the BUGS file.

This file was last revised for distribution with version 0.2.


In no particular order, the following are a few nice-to-have changes (maybe):

* The plugin theoretically supports multiple Buddy Lists (more or less), but
  Pidgin itself seems to be lacking in this regard.

  Should the time come when an interface is added for managing multiple Buddy
  Lists, the preferences of this plugin will likely change to be the default
  settings of new windows.  Perhaps a new sub-menu could be added to choose the
  panes' orientation or whether to display panes at all on a given Buddy List.

* Find ways to properly handle code labeled with "XXX" comments.  They are bits
  of code that just seem wrong for some reason or another.  Unfortunately, most
  of those lines exist to fix crashes that back trace to other subsystems or
  plugins.  (Granted, they are being caused by this plugin's unexpected member
  values in the first place.)
