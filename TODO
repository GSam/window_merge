This file outlines a few ideas to implement or areas with room for improvement
in the plugin.  These items are not necessarily problems to be addressed; for
those, see the BUGS file.

This file was last revised for distribution with version 0.3.


In no particular order, the following are a few nice-to-have changes (maybe):

* Generalize the dummy conversation file so it is as independent of this plugin
  as possible.  While the dummy makes Pidgin a bit more volatile for intrepid
  users, I've found it to be quite handy in using conversation notebooks almost
  as if they were geniune GtkWidgets.  This has helped in my experimenting with
  other plugins that attach conversation areas all over the place.  The next
  item can be considered a milestone for this one.

* Switch to GTK signals for handling the dummy conversation instead of using
  Pidgin's signals.  Pidgin/purple signals just don't cover all of the possible
  scenarios thoroughly.  The GtkNotebook page add/remove signals are a much
  more efficient and rigorous solution.  However, there are a handful of new
  issues needing to be addressed in the transition.

* The plugin theoretically supports multiple Buddy Lists (more or less), but
  Pidgin itself seems to be lacking in this regard.  If Pidgin ever properly
  supports multiple Buddy Lists, this plugin should provide an interface to
  manage them independently.  A submenu on the menu bar seems simple enough.

* Find ways to properly handle code labeled with "XXX" comments.  They are bits
  of code that just seem wrong for some reason or another.  Unfortunately, most
  of those lines exist to fix crashes that back trace to other subsystems or
  plugins.  (Granted, they are being caused by this plugin's unexpected member
  values in the first place.)
